# Request

## Request

The Alexandria library should surface a `documentationCoverage` metric that represents how well-documented a codebase is based on tracked markdown files.

## Current State

The library provides `ComprehensiveDocuments` with:

- `tracked`: documents in CodebaseViews
- `untracked`: documents not in CodebaseViews
- `excluded`: documents excluded from tracking
- `all`: all documents

However, there's no explicit coverage metric exposed, even though the data exists to calculate it.

## Requested API

Add a `documentationCoverage` field to either:

1. **AlexandriaEntry interface** (preferred):

```typescript
export interface AlexandriaEntry extends AlexandriaRepository {
  path: ValidatedRepositoryPath;
  documentationCoverage?: number; // 0-100 percentage
}
```

2. **ComprehensiveDocuments interface** (alternative):

```typescript
export interface ComprehensiveDocuments {
  tracked: string[];
  untracked: string[];
  excluded: string[];
  all: string[];
  coverage: number; // 0-100 percentage
}
```

## Use Case

We're building an Alexandria docs panel in the electron app (AlexandriaDocsPanel.tsx) and want to display documentation coverage to help users understand how well their codebase is documented. This would complement the existing viewCount metric that shows CodebaseView coverage.

## Implementation Notes

- Coverage calculation should be: `(tracked / (tracked + untracked)) * 100`
- Excluded documents should not count toward the denominator
- Return 0 when no trackable documents exist
- Consider caching this value on the AlexandriaEntry to avoid recalculation
